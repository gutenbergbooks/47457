<p>Professors Von Pettenkofer, Parkes, and Buck,
pronounced Hygienists, have contributed largely to
establishing theories regarding clothing materials and
their relations to health. These conclusions have led
to a more general consideration thereof, in the therapeutics,
as well as prophylaxis in medical practice.</p>

<p>Wool is regarded as deserving first consideration.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_b_006.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">MAGNIFIED&mdash;WOOL FIBRE.</div>
</div>


<p>The fibres are cylindrical collections of numerous
cells, and present each the appearance of a tube covered
with epidermic scales which overlap each other.
The zigzag markings are characteristic.</p>

<p>Cotton, for various reasons, may be regarded as
next in importance, providing consideration be given to
the manner of application, in combination with wool.</p>

<p>This is fully verified by Krieger's experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" >

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">SECTION SAME&mdash;COTTON FIBRE.</div>
</div>


<p>The fibres of cotton appear to be made up of flat,
ribbon-shaped cells, thicker at the edges than in the
middle. They are irregularly twisted, with a broad
longitudinal cavity more or less well defined. There
is frequently a kind of net-work striation apparent on
the surface.</p>

<p>With regard to the comparative value of these
fibres in application we refer here to the Tables of
Mattieu Williams, page 31 of this Treatise. It remains,
therefore, to have a material of these fibres so constructed
that it will embody all scientific essentials.
The first satisfactory material of the "Jaros Hygienic
Wear" was laid before the Medical Profession in Chicago,
November, 1884, and, guided by their suggestions,
the "Wool Fleece Fabric" was so materially
improved that, on January 4, 1886, L. L. McArthur, M.D.,
in a paper before the Chicago Medical Society, states:
"Now, gentlemen, this device was a particularly
'happy one,' in that all the requirements of a truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
hygienic wear are provided&mdash;porosity, warmth,
absorbent powers and elasticity."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_008.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">JAROS HYGIENIC MATERIAL&mdash;MAGNIFIED.</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen that the material is a fleecy wool
surface knitted into a cotton framework&mdash;resembling
in many essential points a natural sheep's pelt. A
prominent factor regarded in the claim for a reproduction
of the natural pelt, is the preservation of the yolk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which, if left in the wool, preserves its pliancy. It forms
a kind of natural soap, consisting principally of potash
salts with animal oil almost entirely soluble in cold
water. Special care must therefore be taken in washing
the wool, and this has been one of the latest results
added to the success of the "Jaros Hygienic Material."
The features warranting precaution in scouring wool,
and advised by scientists, are based on the following possibilities:
Excess of alkali has to be guarded against,
since uncombined caustic acts energetically on the
wool fibre, and is indeed a solvent of it. On this
account soap solutions cannot be too carefully prepared
to prevent making the wool brittle.</p>

<p>"A material of loose texture confining much air in
its interstices is warmer than same amount of clothing
material closely woven. Wool or cotton carded and
spread out in the shape of a wadding and held, will
make a warmer garment than the same quantity spun
and woven, and similarly covered. This applies with
force to underclothing."&mdash;"Ziemsen," Vol. XVIII.</p>

<p>PROPHYLAXIS.&mdash;In the consideration of a prophylactic
measure this Underwear accomplishes the
desideratum for protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">L. D. Rogers, A.M., M.D., in a paper, states:</p>

<p>A fabric, therefore, so constructed as to allow a layer of
woolen fibre to lie between the skin and a layer of cotton
fibre, and sufficiently open and loose as to contain
the largest possible amount of air is the ideal. <i>The
Jaros Hygienic Underwear material, a new fabric,
seems beautifully adapted to this end. A layer of
woolen fibres, soft and fleecy, is firmly held on one side
of and in the meshes of an exceeding porous cotton
fabric, so that while one extremity of a fibre lies
against the skin, the other is in contact with the cotton;
thus admitting of the rapid transference of all dampness
of perspiration to the cotton where it is retained,
and consequently leaving no moisture next to the skin
to absorb and diminish the heat of the body. The
importance of this subject, and the possibilities of this
new fabric for the prevention of colds, and their
resultant diseases, can only be appreciated when we
remember the simple fact that it is impossible to take
a cold so long as a healthy condition of the skin, and
an even temperature of the surface of the body, are
maintained</i>.</p>

<p class="center">REPORT OF C. B. HOLMES,</p>

<p class="center">President Chicago City Railway Company.</p>

<p>""The Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has been in use with Conductors and
Gripmen of this Company since November, 1885, having been recommended by
the Company's Surgeon, Dr. D. A. K. Steele. We speak for the men in asserting
that this underwear is considered the best possible protection against cold and
changeable temperatures, which are especially characteristic of this latitude,
and its use has resulted in great protection of health and a corresponding increased
efficiency. With conductors, whose occupation necessarily prevents the
wearing of a very heavy overcoat, it is of great advantage, and gripmen and
drivers are enabled to thoroughly protect themselves in their exposed positions
without an overplus of clothing, otherwise necessary."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Skin.</span>&mdash;* * * The most thorough protection to the skin is
secured by the use of the <span class="smcap">Jaros Hygienic Wear</span>, especially during the cold and

static condition of air next the skin, while the fleece wool combines
the minimum radiation of heat from the body with the greatest attainable hydroscopic
power, thus securing uniform dryness and warmth of the skin under
various conditions of atmosphere. Dr. L. L. McArthur has demonstrated before
the Chicago Medical Society the superiority of the Jaros Wear over all
other fabrics for the purpose of protecting the skin against rapid changes of
temperature and humidity, and my own experience with it altogether bears out
his deduction."</p>

<p>"I am much impressed with the value of the "Jaros Hygienic Wear," especially

<p class="center">ADDRESS BEFORE ELMIRA ACADEMY OF MEDICINE, JULY, 1887.</p>

<p>"The dress of the consumptive patient should be adapted to equalize the
temperature of the body, so loose that it interferes in no way with the natural
functions. The underclothing should be woolen, either lamb's wool or flannel.
After an extended observation of the benefits derived from wearing the "<span class="smcap">Jaros

adapted to the season, I believe it to be the best protective device yet known

<p class="center"><small>[Abstract of a paper read before the Chicago Medical Society on January 4, 1886.]</small></p>


<p>The object of clothing should be the promotion and
maintenance of good health, together with a feeling of
well-being under all atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p>Consideration of the subject naturally sub-divides
itself into:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I. Materials.<br />
&nbsp;II. Texture.<br />
III. Form of clothing.<br />
</p>

<p>Chief among the materials used for clothing in the
order of their respective merits are linen, cotton, silk,
and wool, the latter being the best.</p>

<p>A few words as to these materials in the raw state:</p>

<p>Linen conducts heat better than cotton, silk or wool.
It absorbs moisture and does not shrink. Cotton, also
a vegetable fibre, which is hard, durable and does not
shrink, has serious objections, in that it is very non-absorbent
of moisture. It does not conduct heat as well
as linen, but more rapidly than silk or wool.</p>

<p>Silk, an animal product, consisting of fine, smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
round fibrillæ, having been in the liquid condition before
leaving the body of the silkworm, possesses no central
canal, and no oily coating. It is quite a good absorbent
of moisture, ranking next to wool. At ordinary temperature
it always contains between 9 and 12 per centum
of moisture. In its sale or purchase, account is taken
of the amount of moisture in order to protect the purchaser
from paying silk prices for water.</p>

<p>Wool, the fleece of sheep, an animal fibre, whose
function in nature has been two-fold, the protection
from cold, and an aid to evaporation of cutaneous moisture,
is admirably fitted as a material for clothing. It
permits but slow radiation of heat, and absorbs moisture
better than any other clothing material. It does this,
according to Parkes, in two ways: 1st. By interposition
between the fibres. 2d. By penetration into the
central canal. His experiments led him to believe its
hydroscopic powers double in proportion to its weight
and quadruple for surface, as compared with cotton or
linen. Perfectly dried wool has the power of absorbing
50 per centum, by weight, of water. Under ordinary
conditions it contains 12 to 18 per centum.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, then woolen fabrics will
best prevent too rapid radiation of heat; silk next, cotton
third, linen fourth.</p>

<p>Wash-leather, buckskin and chamois-skin need not
be considered, for one or all of the following reasons:
Expense, poor provision for evaporation, poor washing
qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>As absorbers of moisture, rank, respectively: wool,
silk, linen and cotton.</p>

<p><i>The advantages of cotton over wool lie in its cheapness
and non-shrinking qualities. If properly constructed,
however, the advantageous properties of wool
can be utilized without the shrinking by using a cotton
framework, into the meshes of which the loose, raw
fleece is worked.</i></p>

<p>That fabric will be best adapted for health, which
combined with greatest porosity, possesses the least (a)
conductivity, (b) greatest hydroscopic power, and (c)
best shape.</p>

<p>By porosity is understood the freedom with which
air can pass through the interstices of a fabric. Pettenkoffer's
practical demonstrations with the following
cloths, shows that if heavy flannel be taken as permitting
100 parts of air to pass, linen permitted 60.3 or 60 per
centum; lambskin 50.7 or 50.7 per centum; silk fabric,
heavy, 14.4 or 14.4 per centum; glove-leather 1.5 or 1.5
per centum.</p>

<p>The conclusion follows that porosity does not injure
the powers of preventing radiation (it even increases
it) for flannel, admittedly the warmest clothing, permits
the freest circulation of air.</p>

<p>In consequence of the fact of a fabric's possessing
great porosity, it contains in its interstices what might
be called "residual air." Whether gases possess conductivity
is open to discussion, but this is certain, that
such power is very small. Could we by any means en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>velop
the body in a layer of stationary air, we could
reduce the heat-loss to a minimum. A striking example
of the poor conductivity of <i>stationary air</i> is related by
Dr. Kane, the Arctic explorer, who found that on perfectly
still days they could withstand, without suffering,
a temperature of-70 F.,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> with ears and hands exposed,
but the moment a breeze sprung up it became necessary
to seek immediate shelter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> 70° F, below Zero.</p></div>

<p>Although impossible to perfectly accomplish this,
(<i>i. e.</i>, the surrounding of body in a stationary envelope
of air), that cloth or fabric which most nearly approximates
this, other things being equal, will prove itself
the warmest as well as best adapted for evaporation of
cutaneous moisture. Such a nearly stationary air occurs
naturally in the various pelts, and although in many the
integument is visible beneath, yet they can withstand
the most rigorous weather. Thus Krieger's experiments
with tin cylinders containing hot water with two
coverings of different materials, between which an
interval of &#8539; to &#188; inch was left, proved (after subtracting
the amount due for conduction) the impediment to
radiation by the second layer to be, <i>viz</i>: linen, 32; silk,
32; flannel, 29.</p>

<p>Thus showing that the stationary air, rather than
the material out of which the second layer was made,
was the main factor in preventing radiation.</p>

<p>He then experimented with single and double layers
of the same material surrounding these cylinders, obtaining
the following instructive results; the numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
representing the proportionate loss of heat through
double to single layers, the losses through the single
ones being taken at 100:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="heat loss">
<tr><td align="left">Double Stuff, ("Doppel Stoff") Fleece-lined cotton</td><td align="right">69-76</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Buck-skin</td><td align="right">74-86</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flannel</td><td align="right">86</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Home-spun linen</td><td align="right">91</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Stout, extra heavy silk</td><td align="right">94</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>From these results the conclusion is obvious that the
substance and its weight are of less consequence, where
<i>radiation</i> is in question, than its texture and volume.
Believing that the explanation was due to the "residual
air," experiments have been made with loose wadding,
noting the rapidity of fall of temperature, on compressing
the same wadding, when the fall was far more
rapid.</p>

<p>Again, the loss of heat through a rabbit's fur being
taken as 100, when shorn of its hair it rose to 190; and
further destroying its porosity by a coating of gum-arabic,
it rose to 296. (Dict. Hygiene.)</p>

<p>By greatest porosity best provision is made for the
evaporation of perspiration, the quantity of which
varies greatly under different conditions. In a day of
rest the amount as determined by Seguin and Voit is
900 grams (about 1 quart). During exercise it may
increase to quantities incredible, were the figures not
furnished by the best of observers. For example:
Dalton mentions its increase to 380 grams per hour! and
Dr. Southwood Smith has seen it rise to 1,600 grams
per hour during violent exercise in a heated atmosphere!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Now, if a clothing possesses no porosity, <i>e. g.</i>, the
mackintosh, and rubber clothing generally, even without
exercise, there would collect somewhere beneath it a
quart of water, but if exercise be indulged in, the quantity
may become large indeed; particularly after the
atmosphere beneath has been surcharged with vapor,
and evaporation ceases to occur from the surface, and
with it the grateful cooling process. The French Government
has not permitted its introduction into its army
for such obvious reasons. Of course, for a short time
during a shower they may and do prove useful; but I
am convinced that many have incurred most serious injury,
even death, by throwing off the rubber clothing
after the inner clothing had become permeated with
moisture, when the chilling, incident to the sudden increased
evaporation, has resulted in some acute inflammation.</p>

<p>Moreover, the evaporation of the normal cutaneous
moisture (with that of the lungs) requires 750 heat
units or one-fifth of all the heat produced in the system.
(Dalton.) Conservation of part of this loss contributes
an equivalent amount of force to the organism, since
heat and force are interchangeable terms. <i>This can be
done.</i></p>

<p>Under normal conditions evaporation of perspiration
occurs in the "insensible," <i>i. e.</i>, vapor state, but change
of these conditions (increased heat, and moisture in the
atmosphere, increased exercise, etc.,) causes it to collect
upon the integument in the visible or sensible state, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
unless conducted away, may chill the body. Prevention
of such condensation will avoid such dangerous and
deleterious influences. The cause of condensation is a
lowering of the temperature. <i>We have simply to maintain
its temperature until at a perceptible distance from
the body. This can be accomplished by a layer of loose
wool, such as is hereafter described. The "residual
air" having been once raised to the body temperature,
it remains so, and the vapor does not assume the liquid
state until meeting with the chilling influences in the
outer layer of cloth.</i></p>

<p>Finally, bodies passing from the gaseous to the
liquid state emit the heat&mdash;latent heat&mdash;which was
essential to their assuming the gaseous condition. This
occurring in the case of perspiration in the cloth interstices
increases by just so much their warmth, in other
words lessens the demand for heat production.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of texture, note should
be made of the importance of its being of a loose nature.
<i>However great the hydroscopic power of a material in
the raw state, if it be tightly woven that power is
greatly diminished, or even quite destroyed. Hence the
advantage of loosely knitted over tightly woven goods.</i></p>

<p>Important indeed is the proper fitting of clothing.
However good the materials they may then not accomplish
their purpose for the following reasons:</p>

<p>I. By close application to the skin certain materials
acting as cutaneous stimulants, maintaining an active
equable circulation. Wool possesses this property most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
markedly; even in some delicate skins proving an irritant.
A very marked increase of oily matter is excreted
over these areas where oil-glands exist in greatest abundance,
<i>i. e.</i>, mesial line of thorax, in front and behind;
thus improving the flexibility of the skin.</p>

<p>II. By fitting neatly, chambers of air heated by the
body are not with every change of position of the
wearer forced out, as occurs in illy-fitting clothing.
Upward currents of air naturally occur, and if permitted
to exist carry off large amounts of caloric. Simple
attention to these two facts reduced the death rate of
the Wurtemburg Army Corps from 3.22 to 1.64, as compared
with the other departments of the German Army.</p>

<p>The general application and advantages of such an
ideal clothing to diseased conditions, it is needless for
me to describe to a body of medical men; but particular
references ought to be made to rheumatism and nephritis,
("kidney troubles.") To the former, because best
provision is made for cutaneous elimination (always
acid!) so essential in that disorder, in which there is so
marked a diminution in the alkalinity of the blood; to
the latter because sudden congestions are obviated in an
organ already overworked, by preventing sudden chilling
of the surface.</p>

<p><i>It only remains for me to call your attention to my
accidentally finding such a clothing upon a patient of
mine (Mr. Jaros), and the tests to which I have put it.</i></p>

<p><i>He described its history and manufacture as follows</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>While suffering from an attack of rheumatic
sciatica in the Harz mountains, following a peasant's
advice, I enveloped myself in loose lamb's fleece which
he provided, and I experienced speedy relief. On
reaching Berlin I consulted Chief Councillor-of-Health,
Dr. Abarbanell, who advised me to have constructed
some underwear with a fleece lining. I sought
a weaver and had some underwear knitted, into the
meshes of which were worked, "by hand," during the
process of knitting, layers of loose lamb's wool.</i>"</p>

<p>Now, gentlemen, this device was a particularly
happy one, in that all the requirements of a truly
hygienic wear are provided for.</p>

<p><i>Porosity, warmth, absorbent powers and elasticity.
With advice he set to work and perfected a modification
of the knitting machine which incorporated into the
meshes of the cloth loose lamb's wool. The samples
presented speak for themselves as to its success. By
the use of such a fabric, perspiration (unless excessive
indeed) remains in the insensible state until it meets
with the cooling influences externally in the cotton
framework, the integument remaining dry, while the
cotton back, as well as the linen shirt over it, may be
"wringing wet." Exposure to cold draughts with
such a suit does not chill the integument because
the sudden increased evaporation occurs at a distance
from the skin, and is separated from it by a layer of
wool.</i></p>

<p><i>To test the soundness of the theory I submitted myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
to a temperature of 115° F., under as nearly as
possible the same atmospheric conditions, with the three
chief winter suitings, and obtained the results in table

<p><i>From these experiments it is to be seen, that of all
the perspiration exuded, the silk retained (by a small
amount) the least; the hygienic wear the next, and the
English woolen goods the most. Note, however, must
be taken of two facts concerning the experiment with
the silk clothing.</i></p>

<p><i>1st. The temperature was 2° F. lower than when
testing the hygienic wear, and 8° than the English
goods. Hence less perspiration was thrown out.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>2d. There was a difference of 15.5° of absolute dryness
of the atmosphere, hence evaporation took place
more rapidly from the silk goods in the dryer atmosphere.
The barometer remained almost stationary during
the three days of observation.</i></p>

<p><i>On emerging from the hot room into one of a temperature
of 70° F., an immediate chilling was felt with
the silk goods; while the English gave a sensation of
moisture and cold. The chilly sensation was not experienced
with the woolen-lined hygienic wear.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>CONCLUSIONS.</i></p>

<p><i>1st. That fleece-lined goods are warmest.</i></p>

<p><i>2d. Permit at least equal evaporation with the silk.</i></p>

<p><i>3. Guard against sudden chilling of the body.</i></p>

<p><i>4th. Are cheaper than silk and as cheap as Cartwright
&amp; Warner's.</i></p>

<p><i>5th. Are particularly indicated in rheumatism and
kidney disease.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Mattieu Williams.</span></p>

<hr class="small" />

<blockquote>

<p>The following extracts are from the experiments and
conclusions of Rumford, with supplements by Prof. Mattieu
Williams, of England. (See "Knowledge," Nos. 171 to 205,
"Philosophy of Clothing.")</p></blockquote>


<p>The physiological confirmation of these results are
not quoted; confining the citations to the qualitative value
of fibres, especially sheep's wool, and the possibility of
materials therefrom that possess the <i>essentials</i> recommended.</p>

<p>The first use of clothing being to keep the wearer
warm, Rumford's first inquiry was directed to find the
best material for this purpose. He saw at once that
clothing did this by resisting the passage outwards of
the animal heat.</p>

<p>He accordingly constructed a model wearer, as
described in the following experiments: A mercurial
thermometer, whose bulb was 55/100th of an inch in
diameter, and its tube about ten inches long. This was
suspended in the axis of a cylindrical glass tube about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, ending with a
globe 1 <small>6/10</small> inch in diameter, in such a manner that the
center of the thermometer bulb occupied the center of
the globe, thus leaving a surrounding space to be occupied
by the material to be examined. The thermometer
tube was graduated with 800 divisions between
the freezing and boiling points of water&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, a
Reaumur scale divided to tenths of degrees. The
thermometer was held in its place by a long cork
stopper.</p>

<p>He described his method of clothing the bulb as
follows: The thermometer being taken out of the
cylindrical tube, about two-thirds of the substance which
as to be the subject of the experiment is introduced
into the globe; after which the bulb of the thermometer
introduced a few inches into the cylinder; and after it,
the remainder of the substance being placed round
about the tube of the thermometer: and lastly, the
thermometer being introduced further into the tube,
and being brought into its proper place, that part of the
substance which, being introduced last, remains in the
cylindrical tube above the bulb of the thermometer, is
pushed down into the globe, and placed equally round
the bulb of the thermometer by means of a brass wire,
which is passed through holes made for that purpose in
the stopple closing the end of the cylindrical tube.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The temperature he selected as the starting point
was 70 degrees Reaumur=190 degrees Fahr. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
preferred this to the boiling point, as he could obtain it
accurately by first plunging the whole apparatus duly
charged into nearly boiling water, then allowing it to
fall to 70 degrees, and immediately plunging it into a
mixture of pounded ice and water, where, by the aid of
a little agitation, it remained steadily at the freezing
point.</p>

<p>The following table shows the results with the substances
therein mentioned, the quantity in each case
being 16 grains:</p>

<p>The clothing value or "warmth" of these substances
as thus applied varies directly with these figures,
representing the passage of heat or their "non-conducting"
power.</p>

<p>The experiments described were directed to the
determination of the relative power of different materials.
(We have only quoted the substances most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
generally used for clothing purposes.) These were
followed by another series upon certain given materials
differently arranged, or in different conditions of density.
The same "passage thermometer" was used. The
question to be determined was, whether the protecting
power of the substances used in the previous experiments
was due to the non-conduction of the material
of those substances themselves, or whether the air
imprisoned between their fibres was an important
factor. If the silk, wool and cotton did all the obstructive
work independently of the air, then the amount of
obstruction should vary with the quantity of fibre.
As, in the experiments already described, the fibres
were loosely arranged round the bulk of the thermometer,
it was easy to increase their quantity by packing
them more closely, and yet retaining the other
conditions of bulk, etc., the same.</p>

<p>It was evident from the results, with 16 grains, 32
grains, 64 grains, that the protective power does not
increase nearly in the same proportion as the quantity
of material when packed in the same space. Had such
been the case, and the rate of cooling proportionately
retarded, the experiment (with eider down from the
duck) with 64 grains should have been 1,304x4 5,216
seconds, instead of only 1,615 seconds.</p>

<p>The following displays the results obtained by
using the same material, in same quantity, but differently
disposed, 16 grains of each:</p>

<p>From this it is to be seen that sheep's wool loose
would retard the passage of heat more perfectly than
when spun into thread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The "Jaros Hygienic Material"</span> <i>of sheep's
wool unspun worn next the body possesses the essentials
for non-conduction of heat in a manner described</i>.</p>

<p>It is an instance how an effort to apply pure science
to practical business may react in such manner that
practical business shall become a beneficent contributor
to pure science.</p>

<p>Another practical question suggested is: Whether
clothing materials differ in their powers of absorbing
the cutaneous exhalations; if so, which are the most
effective, and what are the relations of this function to
that of confining air, and thereby maintaining the
temperature of the body? If these two functions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
opposed, then how shall we effect a compromise? If, on
the other hand, they go together in any special material,
the desirability of using this material is doubly indicated.</p>

<p><i>Sheep's wool</i> does absorb (see Knowledge 191) the
aqueous vapor. Loosely distributed fibres of wool in a
suitable fabric take hold of the vapor of the insensible
perspiration in the gaseous form, and by virtue of
gaseous diffusion continually exchange this with the
gasses of the outer atmosphere.</p>

<p>The conclusion, therefore, is that such a material is
best suited for clothing, both in winter and summer.</p>

<p>Sir John Billingall (lecturer on Military Surgery)
mentions his experience in India, and the proof of the
utility of wool in checking the progress of a most
aggravated form of dysentery in the Second Battalion
of the Royals. The result of this has led to the
enforcement of the use of belts for tropical service.
Mr. Sage of the Army Clothing Depot at Pemlico,
tells me many thousands have lately been made there.</p>

<p>My experience and subsequent observations have
proven that, although loosely woven flannels may
advantageously prevent the sudden chills from the
evaporations of accumulated perspiration, this is better
<i>done by a knitted fleecy wool fabric worn next the skin</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><small>(From Peoples' Health Journal, October, 1885.)</small></p>


<p>Considerable scientific attention has recently been
very profitably devoted to the question of fabrics for
underwear most conducive to health. Interesting experiments
have been made developing facts which will
surprise almost everyone on learning them for the first
time. One of the simplest and most readily understood
of these experiments was that of filling tin cans with
hot water and wrapping each one with a different fabric,
and then observing with thermometers the varying
rapidity in the loss of heat. Thus showing accurately
the relative heat preserving value of each fabric. Of
two cans surrounded with the same amount of common
cotton batting, in one case the cotton being compressed,
and the other not, the loss of heat was found to be
much more rapid in the former than in the latter.
Showing, therefore, conclusively, that loose open fabrics
are warmer than those which contain less air in their
interstices. This accords with the well-known fact that
the new flannel is warmer than old which has undergone
the felting or fulling processes. Assuming that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
flannel contains 100 units of air in its interstices, the
permeability of other substances have been found to be
as follows: Linen, 58; silk, 40; buckskin, 58; kid, 1;
chamois, 51. Doubling the layers of any given material
does not diminish the loss of heat in the same proportion.
Assuming the loss of heat through a single layer
to be 100, through a double layer of the same material
it is found to be as follows: Thin silk, 97; gutta percha,
96; shirtings, 95; stout silk, 94; thick home-spun linen,
91; chamois leather, 88-90; flannel, 86; summer buckskin,
88; winter buckskin, 86. Thus we see that the
loss of heat through two layers of thin silk is only three
per cent. less than through one layer. The inference is
that what the substance is and what its weight, does not
make so much difference as its texture and volume.
How the body may lose heat rapidly by wet clothing,
and ill results follow, is shown by the following experiment:
A rabbit was shorn of its fur, its temperature
was then found to be 102 degrees. It was wrapped
with a wet cloth and placed in a room, the temperature
of which was 66 degrees. At the expiration of five
hours the temperature of the rabbit was found to be
76 degrees. The capacity of water to absorb heat is
known to be greater than any other substance. Now,
when our clothing is damp from perspiration or from
any other cause, our bodies lose just as much heat as the
moisture in our clothing is capable of absorbing. The
importance of always having dry material next to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
skin is evident, and that material which will retain the
least moisture is the best. Woolen fibre is found to
answer this purpose more nearly than any other. In
addition to its well-known filtering capacity, it has a
greater stimulating action upon the skin than any other.
On the other hand, cotton fibre, on account of its great
capillary attraction, rapidly absorbs and retains moisture.
A fabric, therefore, so constructed as to allow a layer of
woolen fibre to lie between the skin and a layer of cotton
fibre, and sufficiently open and loose as to contain
the largest possible amount of air is the ideal. <i>The
Jaros Hygienic Underwear material, a new fabric,
seems beautifully adapted to this end. A layer of
woolen fibres, soft and fleecy, is firmly held on one side
of and in the meshes of an exceeding porous cotton
fabric, so that while one extremity of a fibre lies
against the skin, the other is in contact with the cotton;
thus admitting of the rapid transference of all dampness
of perspiration to the cotton where it is retained,
and consequently leaving no moisture next to the skin
to absorb and diminish the heat of the body. The
importance of this subject, and the possibilities of this
new fabric for the prevention of colds, and their
resultant diseases, can only be appreciated when we
remember the simple fact that it is impossible to take
a cold so long as a healthy condition of the skin, and
an even temperature of the surface of the body, are
maintained.</i></p>

<p>My Dear Sir:&mdash;The object of clothing is to preserve the proper heat of
the body, by protecting it both from cold and heat, and thus to prevent the
injurious actions of sudden changes of temperature upon the skin. This
object is most admirably accomplished by the "Jaros Hygienic Wear." I
have demonstrated this most important fact in my own person during the
past six months. For several years past I have been much annoyed by
occasional attacks of muscular Rheumatism. Since I began to wear the
"Jaros Hygienic Clothing" I have been almost entirely free from these
attacks. I deem them a valuable auxiliary in the treatment of <i>Consumption,

Muscular Rheumatism, and since he donned your garments he has not

protect from cold, but heat as well, by aiding in evaporation from the

I have never worn underclothing which gave me so much satisfaction.
The garments are light, warm and delightfully soft, and if properly

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;The "Jaros Hygienic Wear" is unsurpassed in its purpose
of retaining an equable temperature and moisture of the surface of the
body, thus preventing an undue and sudden chilling, thereby inducing
catarrhs of the mucus membranes, conditions so common in this latitude.
Its economy and therapeutic value is apparent.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;I am sincere in expressing a favorable opinion of the "Jaros
Hygienic Wear" so far as my experience allows me to judge. The patients
to whom I have recommended it are of delicate health, very susceptible to
cold. They uniformly expressed themselves as pleased with the garments
made for them by you, and as having suffered far less from the cold this
winter than usual: a result which they attribute directly to the power of
the underclothing to prevent sudden chilling of the body upon transition
from a high to a low temperature. Personally, I have worn the underclothing
all winter, and believe my unwonted freedom from attacks of
bronchitis due to the efficient protection afforded by the underwear. Your
cloth seems to me to be a better non-conductor than other woolen materials,
and therefore particularly suitable to persons with heart or lung
disease.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:&mdash;My attention was called to your Hygienic Underwear
during the session of the International Medical Congress in our city last
September. Being then in search of underwear, which combined the
requisite of warmth, lightness and durability, I determined to try yours,
hoping to find an article which I could with confidence recommend.</p>

<p>I take pleasure in saying that after wearing the garments four months
I find them all I had hoped, and even more.</p>

<p>I have recommended them in several cases of uterine trouble, as well
as for delicate children, and without an exception the patient improved,
which, as other conditions were equal, I know was due to the underwear.</p>

<p>Maintaining an even warmth over the entire surface of the body the
circulation is improved, the various organs respond, and a general improvement
in the patient is the result.</p>

<p>I unhesitatingly recommend the Underwear, and earnestly hope that
many physicians may try it in chronic uterine troubles, and in the wasting
diseases of childhood, as I feel great good to suffering humanity will come
through this agency.</p>

both by myself and a number of my patients, for over two years, and
always with the most satisfactory results. The durability of these goods
is beyond my expectations. I do not expect to wear any other, nor change
in my recommendations while these are on the market.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:&mdash;While I do not believe in the practice of recommending to
others everything or anything you like yourself, I must make an exception
to the rule in the case of your Hygienic Underwear. For years I have
had difficulty in finding the right quality of underwear for myself, always
trying my best to secure the best in the market, but oftener disappointed
than pleased. The goods of your manufacture please me in every respect,
and all to whom I have recommended them speak in the highest terms of
them. There is no doubt in my mind but that many of our winter diseases
and ailments could be avoided, and others easier cured, by the use of these
undergarments. You have my best wishes for success.</p>

<p>
Truly yours,</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;Permit me to add a word to the many which you have undoubtedly
already received in favor of the Jaros Hygienic Underwear. I
have worn them for two winters and one summer and am happy to express
myself as perfectly satisfied with them, for I find they more fully meet my
requirements than any other underwear now upon the market. It is
enough for me to say that my experience with them has proven conclusively
to me that they possess all the properties ascribed to them by the
makers.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;I am not in the habit of giving testimonials, and as a rule
am opposed to any thing of the kind, but after suffering from rheumatism
and kindred diseases for several winters, I was persuaded by a friend to
try Hygienic Underwear, and I am compelled to say that from the time I
began using them last November until spring I did not have a touch nor
a single chill during the entire winter, and I am confident that it was
attributable to the use of your Underwear, and I have not hesitated to recommend
them at every opportunity.</p>

Going home yesterday to dinner, I found awaiting me a suit of underwear,
and I was not very long in putting myself inside of them, but with
no idea that I could wear them, having tried almost everything that contained
wool, but never having found a garment I could wear next to my
skin containing a particle of wool. I have worn the suit for two days
without an unpleasant sensation; on the contrary, they are delightful, and
just what I needed.</p>

<p>I have examined the Jaros Hygienic Underwear, and consider it the most
perfect protection from severe cold and changes in temperature that I ever
saw. Especially will this underwear be useful for those afflicted with rheumatism,
lung troubles, or a dry condition of the skin. If the actual use of
these goods substantiates the theory I have formed, they will be a valuable aid
in the treatment of diseases, as well as to the comfort of the wearers.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>To the President and Members of the National Association Fire

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p>The undersigned Committee on Exhibits begs leave
to submit the following as their report:</p>

<p class="center"><small>THE JAROS HYGIENIC UNDERWEAR FOR FIREMEN</small>.</p>

<p>Underwear is a prime factor in acting as a guard
against influences from without, and if of a properly
constructed material, must tend much toward raising
the efficiency of men in service, and thereby increase
the standard of an already progressive department.
The material&mdash;the Jaros Hygienic Wear&mdash;is a combination
of unspun wool knitted into the meshes of a spun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
cotton fiber. This is after the recommendation of most
eminent medical scientists in America and Europe. The
wool unspun, worn next the body, acts as a cutaneous
stimulant (guarding against irritation so often apparent
with spun fiber), the body temperature being stored
between the individual fibers, prevents the cold from
directly striking the body from without (acting like
double casement windows in a house), and, therefore
so valuable when men are forced to sudden changes
from in-doors to the cold of out-doors. The wool,
again, absorbs moisture from the body, and transports
it readily to the outer framework of cotton, thereby
protecting against the possibility of wet clothing next
the skin to chill the surface at every change in temperature.
The cotton framework without, makes the material
two-fold in its action; for while the wool has a
power of absorption of moisture, the cotton has that of
attraction and retention, so that any perspiration exuded
from the body is taken up by the cotton from the wool
and retained, while any water from without striking
the cotton surface is attracted and retained, and prevented
from penetrating through to the body. With all
this, the material is porous, and does not therefore,
retard the poisonous exhalations from passing off. The
material is as nearly non-shrinkable as can be claimed
of any material, owing to the cotton back, thereby having
an underwear which will fit properly at first as well
as last. No laps or folds to allow air to circulate next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the body are apparent, where the consideration of
shrinkage is discarded (which is the case with wear of
spun wool, whether knitted or woven.) The wear is
also more durable. The cost within the line of good
woolen underwear. With a due consideration of all the
scientific as well as practical facts and experiences, the
Surgeon General of the United States Army recommended
the wear to the Quartermaster-General, War
Department, U. S. Army, and the result of experience
by men and officers has given this underwear prominent
place under the equipments of the Northwestern
posts. They also point with great pride and satisfaction
to the service among Police and Firemen in such
cities where practical application has been made. They
feel assured that the consideration of this subject,
though comparatively new with the chief officers of our
departments, will gain a hearing, with the view of raising
the condition of the men.</p>

<p>Your Committee, upon examination, would recommend
it for your consideration.</p>

<p>Very respectfully submitted,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Jaros</span>&mdash;Dear Sir:&mdash;There has been so great a progress in the
excellence of service in our Fire Department that it is safe to say we are
now at a time when it is necessary to consider matters that will preserve
the good condition of our working forces (the firemen).</p>

<p>The work you are doing in this direction deserves encouragement
with Fire Departments; for a recount of the value of proper underwear
comes strikingly before us after the use of the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear."
The experience of our men has been very satisfactory indeed in
every manner, protecting against the dangerous influences of the extremes
that a fireman must suffer in winter. My first impulse was to consider
the claims you made as exaggerated, but a few facts which are my experience
will illustrate to you how fully this underwear meets the ideals for
protection.</p>

<p>I have been a sufferer of rheumatism for many years, contracted in
service. Since I have worn your underwear it has not troubled me at all,
though I have been subjected to trying service the last winter.</p>

<p>On Saturday evening, the 6th of October, 1888, I put on your underwear.
It was cold and wet, typical New England weather. We had a fire in
a six-story building on the water front lasting four hours. I came out of it
with the water coming out of the tops of my rubber boots, <i>completely
wetted through</i>, so that I had to undress in the yard of my dwelling when
I got home. No ill effects were the result of that; when otherwise I would
have cough, cold, and surely rheumatic attacks.</p>

<p>About November 15th we had a very bad fire and had to fight it three
flights before we got to the top, the sixth story. Usually I get wet at
a fire. In this I did not, but instead I became thoroughly overheated from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
wearing a very heavy pilot cloth coat and the result was, that I got <i>sweated
through</i> and <i>through</i>. I did not get home until 3 o'clock in the morning
(nearly six hours), but <i>I felt splendid</i>. With other underwear, best
woolen, I always experienced a cold wet sensation under similar circumstances,
down my back, and generally miserable until I could make a
change.</p>

<p>This I consider the most important test for firemen and I feel more
than ever that the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" fills a long felt want in
Fire Departments. I cheerfully say: I would not be without it and many
of our men join me in this and say money cannot buy it from us.</p>

<p>Wishing you further success in the introduction of a truly meritorious
article and one based on scientific principles, I am</p>

<p>
Yours truly,</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" furnished by your firm

that they would not wear anything else as a substitute if the cost was

<p>They are no doubt of great value as a protection against the sudden
changes in our climate and proof against taking cold.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;A thorough examination of the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear"
has proven to me the correctness of the scientific theories upon which it is
based. In view of the necessity of a most thorough protection for firemen
to guard against the influences of weather and service, I have taken particular
interest in going into the details of what this Underwear will accomplish. The
reports from other departments place this Underwear as an important requirement
of their clothing, and my impression is that the benefits to men in service
in this department will be marked. From the mention made by Chief Dickinson
on the value of this Wear my opinion is fully borne out.</p>

single case of illness due to exposure of any man who has worn these garments.
They were introduced into this Department about three years ago, and quite
generally adopted by our men. As I have said, our records do not show that a
man was obliged to go off duty during any cold months of the year on account
of sickness. I know of several who did not get the Wear who were ill, and purchased
it later on account of the good words said of it by their comrades. The
Wear is very popular in this Department, and from what our men tell me, they
prefer it to any other.</p>

<p>
INSPECTOR OF POLICE, City of Chicago,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, January, 1889.
</p>

<p>On the recommendation of Dr. Henrotin, Surgeon of Police and Fire
Departments, to Chief and Inspector of the Chicago Police Department,
the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" was brought to the notice of the members
of the force, and has been used for a number of years with greatest satisfaction.
The consideration of personal Hygiene to raise the efficiency of
policemen, is gaining more general attention by Heads of Departments,
and my personal observation as Inspector of this force is corroborative of,
the necessity of regarding the question of clothing for officers; especially
during the inclement and cold seasons, from October 1st to April 1st, when
disabilities arise from exposure, which result in pulmonary and kidney
troubles and rheumatic affections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has proven a most efficient guard,
raising the condition of the men, and bearing out fully the recommendations
of Dr. Henrotin. My personal experience is corroborative of this.
Proper underwear makes an overplus of outer clothing, which is debilitating
for men in service, unnecessary. I take pleasure in giving my opinion,
and the result of experience with our men, and do not doubt that the
underwear, when applied, will assert its worth in all the claims that are
made for it.</p>

the anticipated objection occurring to me before trial, namely, that the
unmixed wool in contact with the skin might prove uncomfortable, has
not appeared. In softness and warmth I have never worn any fabric that
equals it, while my original impression at first sight in regard to the
scientific construction of the principals upon which it is based, has been

DR. E. S. KELLEY, Surgeon of Police.</p>

<p>On a recount of the benefits derived by the policemen of our Department
last winter, I have found a full confirmation of the claims made for
the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear." The peculiarly cold and persistent
changes of temperature made the last season trying for the physical condition
of our officers; added to this a class of winter cholera prevailed
here, which was very debilitating. The observations have been that all
the men who wore the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" were free from these
attacks, and maintained a normal condition throughout.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:&mdash;I can assure you that I am only too happy to furnish you
all information you desire relative to your heavy underwear. I have been
in this country for several years and have tried all grades of heavy fabric,
never found any to meet my wants until I got your goods. Your heavy
underwear can in no way be surpassed. I have been out in the hardest
blizzards known in this country, with the wind at 29 miles, and the mercury
at 46 and 47 degrees below zero, but found myself comfortable; felt a warm
glow of the skin at all times, and I find it washes as well as any ordinary
woolen wear, and does not shrink. I am fully convinced of the excellent
qualities of your goods, and find that a great many of my friends and
others are <i>very</i> anxious for winter to come again so that they may order.
As I find it a protection against all diseases during the cold and damp
seasons, having proven this last winter, I will request many of my comrades
to report to you also.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;I cannot refrain from expressing to you the great satisfaction
and enjoyment I have received from the use of your Jaros Hygienic
Underwear during the past winter. I have been almost free from rheumatic
pains, from which I have heretofore suffered greatly, and also
enjoyed an exception from severe colds, which is a very unusual luxury
with me in the winter season; all of which I must attribute to the protection
afforded by my Hygienics. I am also gratified to find that with the
proper care in washing there is no perceptible shrinkage. In short, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;The "Jaros Hygienic Underwear" has been in use with
Conductors and Gripmen of this Company since November 1885, having
been recommended by the Company's Surgeon, Dr. D. A. K. Steele. We
speak for the men in asserting that this underwear is considered the best
possible protection against cold and changeable temperatures, which are
especially characteristic of this latitude, and its use has resulted in great
protection of health and a corresponding increased efficiency. With conductors,
whose occupation necessarily prevents the wearing of a very
heavy overcoat, it is of great advantage, and gripmen and drivers are enabled
to thoroughly protect themselves in their exposed positions without
an overplus of clothing, otherwise necessary.</p>

<p>The proper protection of men serving in Street Railway Companies is
of the greatest importance; since an efficient service in trying weather is
largely dependent on their prompt response. We have been pleased to
secure for our employees a contract figure on the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear,"
and feel that the benefits fully justify us in our continuance of this
arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. Jaros</span>, Esq., Chicago.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:&mdash;I have critically examined and practically tested the
"Jaros Hygienic Wear," and consider it the best fabric with which I am
acquainted, for retaining the animal heat, and preventing chilling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
body by sudden changes of temperature. I consider the heavy wear especially
valuable for car drivers, firemen, policemen, or those whose occupation
expose them constantly to the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>Through my suggestion to the officials of the Cable Railway Company,
many of the Grip Drivers and Conductors are already using this wear with
the greatest satisfaction, lessening their risk of "taking cold," and bettering
their <span class="smcap">health</span> and <span class="smcap">efficiency</span>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:&mdash;The good reports from Drivers and Conductors of our
Company who are wearing the "Jaros Hygienic Underwear," satisfies us
that the arrangements made for last season's delivery of the wear have
been appreciated.</p>

<p>The excellent protection under every change of temperature during the
winter months, guards against attacks so frequent with men exposed, of
rheumatism, kidney disease, and pulmonary troubles, and all character of
ailments resulting from colds. This is too often cause for irregularities
with men, which is a loss to them and often an inconvenience to the Company.</p>

<p>We believe the underwear good, and just the thing for the purposes it
is advocated.</p>

is not only undesirable, but positively dangerous, as such heavy outside garments
impede their movements, and thus place them in danger of accidents.</p>

<p>I especially recommend this wear to railway employees as a means of comfort,
safety and health.</p>

<p>
Very truly,</p>

<p class="right">634 Cleveland Avenue,<br />
<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>, April 3, 1890.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;You are acquainted with the history of my accidently learning
of your underwear, and know the many doubts I had while purchasing. I
have given the garments the severest tests possible to satisfy myself whether
the goods were really what I so much needed, and would hold out in the claims
you made.</p>

<p>I have bought the best woolen and heaviest silk underwear in prominent
cities where I have travelled, abroad as well as in this country, with the
special view of getting something that would protect me while in my rubber
dress, on the long, cold and damp voyages I make. The exercise and heavy
rubber suit which I wear often cause active perspiration, and my observation
has been that from one to one and a half pounds of moisture is thrown off during
an exhibition lasting from one and a half to two hours. With all other
kind of underwear, this moisture was taken up only partially, the garments
becoming thoroughly wet, and causing a chilling which was always hard for me
to overcome; in fact, after these aquatic exhibitions, I found it absolutely necessary
to be well rubbed to draw the blood to the surface and produce reaction,
to prevent trouble.</p>

<p>I speak of other underwear to give you an idea of this action, and the difference
in the body under trying conditions.</p>

<p>Your wool I found admirably selected and prepared, and so incorporated to
act quickly and absorb the moisture thrown off.</p>

<p>My experience is that the "<i>Jaros Hygienic Underwear</i>" does not only
relieve the body of perspiration, but also carries it to the cotton framework
outside, which thoroughly retains it, thereby keeping the wool inside perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>Since I began to use the underwear, I have never felt the chilling which
had always affected me with other underclothing, and I do not find rubbing
after an exhibition necessary.</p>

<p>I have no trace of rheumatic pain, and I feel physically much better. The
difference in the amount of perspiration seems to me marked, which I attribute
to the fact that the body temperature remains more nearly the same. I am so
well pleased with your underwear, that I use it for general wear as well, and
find every point you have claimed to be realized in its use. In conclusion, I can
say, that your underwear is a boon and blessing to men exposed as sailors, firemen,
soldiers, and as well as the general public. Wishing you the success you
deserve,</p>

<p>
I remain, yours very respectfully,</p>
